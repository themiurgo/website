The importance of spatial information in Online Social Networks is increasing
at a fast pace. The number of users regularly accessing services from their
phones is rising and, therefore, local information is becoming more and more
important, for example in targeted marketing and personalized services. In
particular, news, from gossips to security alerts, are daily spread across
cities through social networks. Content produced by users is consumed by their
friends or followers, whose locations can be known or inferred. The spatial
location of users' social connections strongly affects the areas where such
information will be disseminated. As a consequence, some users can deliver
content to a certain geographic area more easily and efficiently than others,
for example because they have a larger number of friends in that area.

In this paper we present a set of metrics that quantitatively capture the
effects of social links on the spreading of information in a given area. We
discuss possible application scenarios and we present an initial critical
evaluation by means of two datasets from Twitter and Foursquare by discussing a
series of case studies.
