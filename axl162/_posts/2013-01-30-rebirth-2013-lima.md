One of the most interesting trends in the recent years has been the
re-discovery of spatial locality, i.e., of the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.
In a world of global spreading of information, location is assuming a
fundamental role again. We can consider it as a sort of "rebirth" of
locality.

In this position paper, firstly, we present a brief summary of our
current work on models, algorithms, applications and tools based on and
for spatially-embedded social networks, i.e., networks where the
interacting individuals have a well-defined position in space.
Our work is focussed on global phenomena that are experienced at a very
local scale: we believe that the availability of real-time information
about individuals at local, community and global level can be exploited
<em>together</em> in order to develop and support novel models,
applications and systems.
In the second part of the paper we outline the challenges and the
opportunities in this promising area, discussing key open problems and
research directions.
