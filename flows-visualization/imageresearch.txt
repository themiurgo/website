On 4 July the discovery of a Higgs boson-like particle at CERN was announced, an event that will be remembered as one of the milestones of the scientific endeavor of the 21st century. We analyzed the complete set of tweets that were sent during the week of the event and we developed a model that is able to reproduce the global behavior of about 500,000 users with remarkable accuracy. This picture shows the geographic network of retweets related to the announcement of the Higgs boson discovery during the week taken into consideration. Every arc changes colour from yellow at the origin of the retweet to red towards the destination.

The goal of my PhD work is to investigate models and measures that are able to characterise interactions and information dissemination happening on large-scale spatial social networks. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive these phenomena can lead to potential interesting applications in diverse areas, including marketing and system design. For example, the discovery of elements and patterns that determine the popularity of a piece news can be be very useful not only to predict its audience over time but also to increase/decrease its diffusion by means of external stimuli.
