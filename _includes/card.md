I am a Data Scientist at Vodafone UK, leveraging machine learning, data science and big data technologies to develop predictive models and run experiments that support the business.

In the past I have also worked as a Vest Scholar at MIT, as a Research Intern at Telefonica Digital and as a Data Science Research Fellow at [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/).
